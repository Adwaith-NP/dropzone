DropZone is a cross-platform file sharing software that works on **Linux**, **Windows**, and **Mac**.  
It uses **UDP** for discovering receivers (sharing IP and Drop Name) and **TCP** for transferring files.

```

2. Run in **Sender Mode** with a single file:
```bash
dropzone -s -f ./file.txt
```

3. Send a whole directory:
```bash
dropzone -s -d ./myfolder
```

4. Send file list:
```bash
dropzone -s -fl ./myfolder,./myfolder2,./myfolder3
```

5. Use a custom port:
```bash
dropzone -s -f ./file.txt -p 9090 
dropzone -r -p 9090 
```

6. Use a custom name:
```bash
dropzone -r -n MyDropZone
```

7. Use a custom ip:
```bash
dropzone -s -f ./file.txt -ip 198.162.87.12

## Project Info
- **Project**: DropZone - File Sharing Software
- **Transport**: 
  - **UDP** â†’ Used for sharing IP and DropZone name (discovery).
  - **TCP** â†’ Used for file transfers.

## How DropZone Works

### 1. Network Setup
- Both the **sender** and the **receiver** must be connected to the same network (LAN/Wi-Fi).

### 2. Receiver Broadcast
- The **receiver** broadcasts its DropZone name and IP address over the network.

### 3. Sender Discovery
- The **sender** listens for these broadcasts.  
- A list of available receivers is displayed to the sender.

### 4. Receiver Selection
- The **sender selects** a receiver from the list.

### 5. Metadata Sharing
- The sender sends **file metadata** (file name, size, or directory structure) to the receiver.  
- The sender waits for the receiver to respond.

### 6. Receiver Review
- The **receiver** receives the metadata.  
- Details are displayed:
  - If itâ€™s a **file**: the receiver can view the file name and size (or skip).  
  - If itâ€™s a **directory**: the receiver can view the full directory tree with file sizes (or skip).  

### 7. Acceptance Decision
- The receiver is asked to **accept** or **reject** the transfer.  
- If **rejected** â†’ the process ends.  
- If **accepted** â†’ the download begins.
